# DREAMS Telescope in a nutshell:

The Dynamic REd All-Sky Monitoring Survey (DREAMS) is a cutting-edge 0.5-meter infrared telescope strategically situated at the Siding Spring Observatory, part of the Australian National University. DREAMS is pioneering in its application of Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) detectors, which, despite having a higher noise profile, offer a cost-effective alternative to the traditionally used mercury-cadmium-telluride (HgCdTe) detectors in infrared astronomy. The telescope is equipped with the advanced Princeton Infrared Technologies 1280SCICAM, enabling high-sensitivity observations across the near-infrared spectrum.

DREAMS is designed to push the boundaries of wide-field time-domain astronomy in parallel with other surveys such as Palomar Gattini-IR and WINTER. As a southern sky near-infrared time-domain survey, DREAMS is uniquely positioned to contribute to a range of astrophysical phenomena significantly. These include detecting and characterising Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), studying variable stars such as RR Lyrae, and advancing multi-messenger astronomy by providing crucial infrared observations that complement data from other wavelengths and messengers.
